# Capstone Project I

This repository contains a finance calculator coded with Python.

The application first asks a user to input whether they want to calculate an "investment" or a "bond". 

If a user chooses "investment", then they are futher asked to specify "simple" or "compound" interest. Depending on their choice, they will be asked to input variables related to the equation and then the total amount at the end of their investment period will be calculated.

If a user chooses "bond" then the user will be asked further inputs related to the bond calculation. The application will then calculate the monthly repayment amount.

Robin Titus is the maintainer and contributor of this project.
